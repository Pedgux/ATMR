### Attempt At a Multiplayer Roguelike (ATMR) 

Inspired by Nathan Daniel's [Roguelike Theory of Relativity (RTOR) ](docs/Nathan_Daniels_-_RTOR__Roguelike_Theory_of_Relativity_(2009).pdf)  
Built with Spectre.Console for console UI and rendering: https://spectreconsole.net/  
Uses Arch as it's ECS: https://github.com/genaray/Arch 


This is a personal project, which I hope to bring to light someday.
